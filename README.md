# Breast-Cancer-Analysis

About 1 in 8 U.S. women (about 12%) will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. There are two types of tumors: Benign
and Malignant. Malignant tumor is cancerous and is dangerous if it is not treated in the early stages. It is also very expensive in the United States
for the cancer diagnosis and treatment. Hence, in the search to find a cheaper diagnosis technique, we propose a few models like logistic
regression, linear classification on PCA(Principal Component Analysis) and Random Forest, which can help diagnose breast cancer as benign or
malignant.
